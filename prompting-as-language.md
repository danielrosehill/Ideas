## Defining the language of prompt engineering

**Contention:**

While the language in which we write prompts *looks* like normal language, it's actually something quite different.

The Latinophiles in the room might call it *sui generis*: 

It's not (quite) the language that we use when we speak to someone. It's not quite *pseudocode* (I would contend, at least). Nor is it a language in the sense of a defined programming language like, say, Python.

This has sometimes got me wondering: **what is it then?!**

## And this led me to prompt...

>Have there been any attempts to define the type of language that prompt engineers use when prompting LLMs? Or more specifically: to define a standard syntax for instructing LLMs to do things like chain prompts or structure a response in a particular way? 

And perhaps a little more imaginatively:

>Imagine that the language in which prompts were written is were defined as a semi-structured language. Could prompts be highlighted with syntax highlighting much as programming languages are to visually highlight common artifacts in prompts like example usage, instructions, etc?

## It probably exists?

I came up short running these prompts, but I have a very strong suspicion that it either already exists or is being worked on. 

## Update this note

If you know of any projects working on this, I would love to know about them.
